We will design a system for the hotel that allows customers to make online reservations and includes an administrative panel to manage in-hotel operations. Design Requirements/Constraints: Based on the architectural decisions and experiences of those who have developed similar projects, we found that the C# language, combined with Azure cloud services and the HTTPS protocol using a RESTful web service, is suitable for a layered architecture project.
